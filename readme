Overview: this repository contains parallelized and non-parallel versions to detect change points
in diffusion and velocity

Requirements: GNU C Library 2.12.2+, OpenMPI 1.4.2+ (parallel only)

Instructions:
(1)	Build programs using makefile
(2)	Run using the following arguments: filename, alpha, beta, delta_t
	(a) alpha is the Type-I error
	(b) beta is the confidence region. Only accepts values from {0.69, 0.90, 0.95, 0.99}
	(c) delta_t is the time-step
(3)	Output is a file with the name of the file appended with .cp that has the time index of the 
	change point detected and the left and right confidence intervals

Example: The following runs parallel diffusion/velocity change point detection on the file file1 
		 with two processes and a Type-I error of 0.05 and a confidence interval of 0.95

		Type into command terminal:
		mpirun -np 2 Parallel-DV 0.05 0.95

		Output file would be file1.cp
		Sample from file1.cp:	
		99 97 104

		This indicates that a change point was found at the 99th time step. 
		Confidence region is from index 97 to 104

Example: The following runs diffusion/velocity change point detection on the file file1 
		 with two processes and a Type-I error of 0.05 and a confidence interval of 0.95

		Type into command terminal:
		Single-DV 0.05 0.95

		Output file would be file1.cp
		Sample from file1.cp:	
		99 97 104

		This indicates that a change point was found at the 99th time step. 
		Confidence region is from index 97 to 104
