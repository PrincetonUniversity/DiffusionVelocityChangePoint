Overview: This repository contains parallelized and non-parallel (single) programs to detect change points
in diffusion and velocity; different versions are in separate branches.

Requirements: GNU C Library 2.12.2+, OpenMPI 1.4.2+ (parallelized only)

Instructions:
(1)	Build programs using makefile
(2)	Run using the following arguments: filename, delta_t, alpha
	(a) delta_t is the time-step
	(b) alpha is the Type-I error
(3)	Output is a file with the name of the file appended with .cp that has the time index of the 
	change point detected and the left and right confidence intervals

Example: The following runs parallel diffusion velocity change point detection on the file file1 
	 with two processes and a timestep of 0.001 and a Type-I error of 0.05

		Type into command terminal:
		mpirun -np 2 Parallel-DV 0.001 0.05

		Output file would be file1.cp
		Sample from file1.cp:	
		99 97 104

		This indicates that a change point was found at the 99th data point. 
		Confidence region is from index 97 to 104
